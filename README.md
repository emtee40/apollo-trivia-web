## What is this site
Improve you knoledge of the Apollo missions to the Moon with this website! I created this for fun and because I have a passion for programming. I created an android app, but I forgot how everyone in my life has an iPhone and I wanted them to be able to use it. It is really simple and very ugly, but it gets the job done. I am working on making it a lot better. 

# Android
This is the web version of my Android App you can find on the play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.jakevossen.apollotrivia&hl=en). 
You can also view that code on Github [here](https://github.com/jakevossen5/Apollo-Trivia). 

## Contributing
I understand that it is kinda weird to make part of a website open source, but I just wanted to share everyone my process and maybe someone could help one day. Please contact me with questions or feature requests and I would love pull requests as well.
